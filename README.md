This Python script helps you organize files in a specified directory into folders based on their file extensions. The user can input the directory, file extensions, and corresponding folder names through a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter.

## Features

- **Easy to Use:** Simply run the executable, input the directory, and define extensions with their corresponding folder names via the GUI.
- **Customizable:** Define your own file extensions and corresponding folder names to suit your needs.
- **Efficient:** Organize your files quickly and efficiently without the hassle of manually moving them around.

## How to Run

    Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
    Install the required dependencies (shutil and tkinter).
    Run the script using the command: python file_organizer.py

## Example

Suppose you have files like 'example.jpg', 'report.pdf', and 'music.mp3' in your specified directory. After running the executable and inputting the details through the GUI, these files will be organized into respective folders:

- **Images:** example.jpg
- **Docs:** report.pdf
- **Audio:** music.mp3
